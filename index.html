  <div class="About">
    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I have a strong background in customer service, 
      having worked in the field for 5 years. Alongside that, I was raised in the construction industry. 
      My father was a carpenter and had taught me the values of hard work, dedication, persistance, and high attention to detail.
      I have had a life-long interest in computers, videogames, and programming. One of my earliest dreams was to build videogames, ever since I beat <span>Donkey Kong Country on the SNES</span> &#x1F98D.
      Technology fascinates me, and I am eager to learn more about it. With my customer experience, ability to work independently or with a team, and enthusiasm for programming,
      I have the potential to become a well-rounded professional in the tech industry.
